# Overview

Make machines study lmao

## Supervised learning  
Given date and knows what correct output looks like, teaches the relation of data to machine to make it do predictions on unseen cases. 

### Model Overview: 

> Given input features $x$ and output $y$, training example can be written as:  
>
> $$ (x^i, y^i) \ where \ i \in m$$
> $m$ is the number of training examples.  
> Training set is given to learning algorithms to produce hypothesis $h(x)$ used to make prediction. Parameterized by $\Theta/\theta$ in many algorithms

## Unsupervised Learning

Machine derives structure to the data on it own, we don't know how the result will look like, for example grouping data into clusters.
